##starting another series of learning object oriented programming to fully understand the concepts

class Employee:
    pass

##creating instances of Employee
employee1 = Employee()
employee2 = Employee()

print(employee1)
print(employee2)

##creating instance variables (variables of the instances)
employee1.name = "Simon"
employee2.name = "Hardazy"

##printing instance variables
print(employee1.name)
print(employee2.name)
